# react-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate of how I set up a React project. It includes react, reactdom, webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, and the necessary babel packages. After cloning or downloading the project, navigate to your project in your Terminal window and do the following: 

(1) Run "npm install"

(2) Run "npm run dev" 

After that, go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see your app.
